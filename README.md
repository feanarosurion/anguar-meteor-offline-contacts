A demonstrate of using GroundDB with Angular-Meteor.

On the way I find solution about working with offline data in Android/iOS of Meteor. Can not find any example about using GroundDB with Angular-Meteor so I create a new one to help other people save time with it.

Simply git clone and metoer run android to test.
